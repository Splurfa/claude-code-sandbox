# Gemini Agent Workspace

**External Agent**: Google Gemini (Gemini 2.0 Flash Thinking Experimental)
**Purpose**: Parallel research, validation, and contributions to common-thread-sandbox
**Status**: Active

## ⚠️ Claude Code: Do Not Edit

This directory is managed by an external Gemini agent running independently. Claude Code and Claude Flow should **NOT** modify files here unless explicitly directed by the user.

## About This Workspace

The Gemini agent operates as an external contributor, providing:
- System validation and verification
- Documentation restructuring and migration
- Independent research and analysis
- Cross-model collaboration

## Contents

External agent research and contributions will be integrated into the main workspace only when the user explicitly requests synthesis.

### Current Work

- **system-validation-report/** - Validation of meta-skill deployment and system integrity

## Integration Protocol

When the user requests integration of Gemini's work:
1. User explicitly directs Claude Code to review and integrate
2. Claude Code reads the artifacts in this directory
3. Integration happens with proper attribution
4. Changes are tracked through normal git workflow
