### [11:49 PST] Session: session-20251121-094621-tour-guide-skill

**Completed**: Created complete tour-guide skill with 4 proficiency-based pathways (Beginner, Intermediate, Advanced, Expert). Comprehensive quality improvements via Perfect Sweep bringing all pathways to 95-97/100 scores.

**Key decisions**:
- "Show don't do" principle - tour demonstrates but never auto-invokes skills
- Statistics as ranges (not static numbers) - resilient to workspace growth
- Agent count standardization: "50+ documented (22 base + extensibility → 80+)"
- Progressive skill disclosure by proficiency level

**Quality improvements**:
- Before: 91.5/100 average (Intermediate 87/100 was below threshold)
- After Perfect Sweep: 95.75/100 average (all pathways 95-97/100)
- Root cause fixed: Static numbers replaced with maintenance-free ranges

**Artifacts created**:
- `.claude/skills/tour-guide/` - Complete skill (14 files, 608KB)
  - 4 tour pathways (7,550 total lines, 16,450 words)
  - Technical summary for partner (14,856 words)
  - Bookmark manager + skill coordinator libraries
- Documentation updates: CLAUDE.md, docs/README.md, docs/setup/quick-start.md
- Session artifacts: 14 research docs, 5 test reports

**Multi-agent coordination**: 19 agents total (6 research, 4 development, 5 testing, 4 Perfect Sweep)

**Next steps**: Test tour live with `/tour-guide`, share technical summary with partner, monitor usage patterns
