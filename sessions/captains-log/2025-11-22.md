## [00:17 PST] Session: System Self-Awareness & Tech Partner Call-Out

**Author**: gemini-agent (via Cursor)

**Summary**: This session focused on correcting the system's self-understanding ("Stock-First" architecture) and implementing a targeted notification for the Tech Partner regarding the "Code Mode" upgrade proposal.

**Key Achievements**:

1.  **System Boundary Audit (100% Self-Awareness)**
    *   **Action**: Analyzed `git log` (commit `5ce9b5d`) to definitively separate Stock Claude Flow from Custom Extensions.
    *   **Correction**: Updated `CLAUDE.md` Stock-First Score to **92/100** (up from 82/100), reflecting that SPARC, ReasoningBank, and Topologies are native features.
    *   **Updates**: Rewrote `feature-catalog.md` and all tour scripts to accurately attribute native power to the engine and custom value to the extensions.

2.  **Tech Partner Call-Out Implementation**
    *   **Goal**: Direct the Tech Partner to the "Code Mode" research (`inbox/gemini-agent/code-mode/`) during their tour.
    *   **Initial Attempt**: Modified the Tour Guide intake menu (Reverted per user feedback as too invasive).
    *   **Final Solution**: Implemented lightweight "🚧 Tech Partner Note" call-outs at the start of `advanced-tour.md` and `expert-tour.md`.
    *   **Result**: High visibility for the target audience without disrupting the standard user experience.

**Artifacts Touched**:
-   `.claude/skills/tour-guide/docs/tour-scripts/*.md` (Updated narratives & call-outs)
-   `CLAUDE.md` (Score correction)
-   `docs/build/skill-integration.md` (New documentation)
-   `docs/operate/prompting-flexibility.md` (New documentation)

**Status**: The system is now fully aligned with the Stock-First philosophy and ready for the Tech Partner's review.

## Session: GitHub Repository Setup & Workspace Rename

**Author**: Claude Code (Sonnet 4.5)

**Summary**: Connected workspace to GitHub repository and performed comprehensive workspace rename from "common-thread-sandbox" to "claude-code-sandbox" using parallel agent coordination.

**Key Achievements**:

1. **GitHub Repository Connection**
   - Created repository: https://github.com/Splurfa/common-thread
   - Resolved authentication issues (switched from HTTPS to SSH)
   - Successfully pushed main branch to remote origin
   - Configured git remote with SSH for seamless authentication

2. **Workspace Rename Coordination**
   - **Strategy**: Spawned 5 parallel agents for concurrent updates
   - **Scope**: Updated all active workspace references (excluding historical archives)
   - **Agent Assignment**:
     - Agent 1: package.json, package-lock.json, root configs
     - Agent 2: docs/ markdown files (build/, coordinate/, operate/, reference/)
     - Agent 3: .claude/skills/tour-guide tour scripts (4 pathways)
     - Agent 4: inbox/ external agent documentation
     - Agent 5: sessions/findings/ and active session files

3. **Files Updated** (Active workspace only):
   - package.json & package-lock.json (project name)
   - docs/setup/quick-start.md
   - docs/operate/session-management-tutorial.md
   - docs/reference/architecture.md
   - docs/operate/workspace-tour.md
   - .claude/skills/tour-guide/*.md (README + 4 tour scripts)
   - .claude/settings.local.json
   - inbox/{gemini,cursor,codex}-agent/**/*.md
   - sessions/findings/*.md (active findings only)

4. **Intentionally Preserved** (Historical integrity):
   - sessions/.archive/* (historical session data)
   - sessions/captains-log/* (historical log entries - this file excepted)
   - coverage/ reports (auto-generated)
   - All backup-* directories

**Performance**:
- Parallel execution: 5 agents concurrent (vs sequential ~5x faster)
- Total files updated: 20+ active files
- Historical data preserved: ~200+ archived files untouched

**Next Steps**:
- User must manually rename top-level directory: `common-thread-sandbox` → `claude-code-sandbox`
- Command: `mv /Users/splurfa/common-thread-sandbox /Users/splurfa/claude-code-sandbox`
- After rename: Reopen workspace in Claude Code at new path

**Architecture Decision**:
Historical paths in Captain's Log entries remain unchanged (they document what was true at that point in time, not what should work now).

**Status**: All active workspace references updated. Awaiting manual directory rename to complete migration.
