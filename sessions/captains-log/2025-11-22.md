   - Verification Scout - Final 100% consistency audit

2. **Comprehensive Audit Results**
   - **Files Analyzed**: 217+ active workspace files
   - **Technical References**: 149 "claude-code-sandbox" paths verified as correct
   - **Consistency Score**: 100% in active files
   - **Historical Preservation**: 2430+ archived files untouched

3. **Files Updated** (Active workspace only):
   - README.md - Title updated to "Claude Code Sandbox"
   - docs/operate/workspace-tour.md - Replaced hardcoded paths
   - docs/setup/quick-start.md - Updated workspace references
   - docs/reference/architecture.md - Fixed absolute path references
   - docs/operate/session-management-tutorial.md - Updated naming
   - .claude/skills/tour-guide/README.md - Updated workspace reference
   - .claude/skills/tour-guide/tour-guide.yaml - Updated metadata
   - .claude/skills/tour-guide/docs/tour-scripts/beginner-tour.md - Updated intro
   - .swarm/hooks/inbox-archive.js - Fixed hardcoded path (line 37)

4. **Verification & Quality Assurance**
   - Generated 11 detailed verification reports
   - Cross-referenced against audit artifacts
   - Validated no unintended changes
   - Confirmed all path references consistent
   - Captain's Log verification and coherence check

**Session Artifacts** (11 documentation files):
- `naming-search-results.md` - Comprehensive search results
- `readme-audit.md` - README analysis
- `config-audit.md` - Configuration audit
- `docs-audit.md` - Documentation audit
- `documentation-updates.md` - Core docs changes summary
- `skills-updates.md` - Skills changes summary
- `config-updates.md` - Config changes summary
- `VERIFICATION-REPORT.md` - Complete analysis and findings
- `BEFORE-AFTER-SAMPLES.md` - Visual examples
- `FILES-UPDATED-SUMMARY.md` - Summary of changes
- `test-verification.md` - Test results

**Performance Metrics**:
- Parallel agent execution: 4 concurrent workers
- Total files updated: 9 active files
- Total line edits: 10 substantive changes
- Execution time: Parallel (vs ~4x sequential)

**Quality Validation**:
- ✅ Zero inconsistencies in active workspace
- ✅ Historical integrity preserved (2430+ archived files untouched)
- ✅ External materials protected (inbox/user/ unchanged)
- ✅ Git history clean (no destructive changes)

## [00:17 PST] Session: System Self-Awareness & Tech Partner Call-Out

**Author**: gemini-agent (via Cursor)

**Summary**: Corrected system's self-understanding ("Stock-First" architecture) and implemented targeted notification for Tech Partner regarding "Code Mode" upgrade proposal.

**Key Achievements**:

1. **System Boundary Audit (100% Self-Awareness)**
   - Analyzed `git log` (commit `5ce9b5d`) to separate Stock Claude Flow from Custom Extensions
   - Updated `CLAUDE.md` Stock-First Score to **92/100** (from 82/100)
   - Reflected that SPARC, ReasoningBank, and Topologies are native features
   - Rewrote `feature-catalog.md` and tour scripts for accurate attribution

2. **Tech Partner Call-Out Implementation**
   - Goal: Direct Tech Partner to "Code Mode" research (`inbox/gemini-agent/code-mode/`)
   - Initial attempt: Modified tour guide intake menu (reverted as too invasive)
   - Final solution: Lightweight "🚧 Tech Partner Note" call-outs in `advanced-tour.md` and `expert-tour.md`
   - Result: High visibility without disrupting standard user experience

**Artifacts Touched**:
- `.claude/skills/tour-guide/docs/tour-scripts/*.md` (Updated narratives & call-outs)
- `CLAUDE.md` (Score correction)
- `docs/build/skill-integration.md` (New documentation)
- `docs/operate/prompting-flexibility.md` (New documentation)

**Status**: System fully aligned with Stock-First philosophy. Ready for Tech Partner review.

## [00:20 PST] Session: GitHub Repository Setup & Workspace Rename (COMPLETED)

**Author**: Claude Code (Sonnet 4.5)

**Summary**: Connected workspace to GitHub repository and performed comprehensive workspace rename from "common-thread-sandbox" to "claude-code-sandbox" using parallel agent coordination. Directory rename completed by user.

**Key Achievements**:

1. **GitHub Repository Connection**
   - Created repository: https://github.com/Splurfa/common-thread
   - Resolved authentication issues (switched from HTTPS to SSH)
   - Successfully pushed main branch to remote origin
   - Configured git remote with SSH for seamless authentication

2. **Workspace Rename Coordination**
   - Spawned 5 parallel agents for concurrent updates
   - Updated all active workspace references (excluding historical archives)
   - Updated package.json, docs/, skills/, and inbox/ references
   - Intentionally preserved historical data (2430+ archived files)

3. **Directory Rename** (Completed)
   - User renamed top-level directory: `common-thread-sandbox` → `claude-code-sandbox` ✅
   - All subsequent naming audit verified consistency ✅
   - Workspace now fully consistent with folder name ✅

4. **Intentionally Preserved** (Historical integrity):
   - sessions/.archive/* (historical session data)
   - sessions/captains-log/* (historical log entries, except this file)
   - coverage/ reports (auto-generated)
   - All backup-* directories

**Architecture Decision**:
Historical paths in Captain's Log entries remain unchanged (document workspace state at that point in time, not current working paths).

**Status**: ✅ COMPLETE. Directory rename completed by user. Naming consistency verified by subsequent naming audit session.
