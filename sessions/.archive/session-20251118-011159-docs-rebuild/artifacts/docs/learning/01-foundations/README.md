# Foundations: Phase 1: Foundations

Welcome to Phase 1: Foundations! In this phase is about understanding the landscape before diving into action.

## What You'll Learn

By the end of this phase, you'll understand:
- What claude-flow is and why it matters
- How your workspace is organized
- How to start and manage sessions
- Basic memory usage for coordination

## Time Commitment

**Total**: Foundations phase completed at your own pace
- Lessons 1-2: What is Claude-Flow? (1 hour)
- Phase 3: Workspace Tour (1 hour)
- Phase 4-5: Your First Session (1 hour)
- Lessons 6-7: Basic Memory Usage (1 hour)

## Learning Order

**Start here, in this exact order:**

1. [What is Claude-Flow?](what-is-claude-flow.md) - The big picture
2. [Workspace Tour](workspace-tour.md) - Where everything lives
3. [Your First Session](first-session.md) - Hands-on practice
4. [Basic Memory Usage](basic-memory-usage.md) - How agents coordinate

## You'll Know You're Ready When...

✅ You can explain what claude-flow does in one sentence
✅ You know where session artifacts are stored
✅ You've successfully started and closed a session
✅ You've stored and retrieved data from memory

## Practice Project

**Build a simple task tracker** (30 minutes)

By the end of Phase 1: Foundations, try this:
1. Start a new session called "task-tracker"
2. Spawn one agent to create a simple to-do list
3. Store the task list in memory
4. Retrieve and display it
5. Close the session properly

Don't worry about making it perfect. The goal is to practice the workflow.

## Common Phase 1: Foundations Questions

**Q: How is this different from just using Claude directly?**
A: Think of it like this - regular Claude is one person. Claude-flow lets you coordinate a team of specialists who work in parallel and remember what they learned.

**Q: Do I need to understand the code it generates?**
A: Not initially. Focus on orchestration first. Understanding generated code comes in Phase 2: Essential Skills.

**Q: What if I make a mistake?**
A: Sessions are isolated. You can delete a session folder without affecting anything else. That's the beauty of the system.

## Next Phase Preview

In Phase 2: Essential Skills, you'll learn to spawn multiple agents in parallel and coordinate their work through memory. You'll build something real and see the power of parallel execution.
