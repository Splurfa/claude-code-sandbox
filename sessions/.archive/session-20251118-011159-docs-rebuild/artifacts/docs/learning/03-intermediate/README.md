# Intermediate: Phase 3: Intermediate

Welcome to Phase 3: Intermediate! You've mastered the basics. Now you'll learn complex coordination patterns used in production systems.

## What You'll Learn

By the end of this month, you'll understand:
- Swarm topologies (mesh, hierarchical, star, ring)
- When to use each topology for optimal coordination
- Queen selection strategies (strategic, tactical, adaptive)
- Consensus mechanisms for critical decisions
- Custom workflow patterns

## Time Commitment

**Total**: Intermediate phase spread across the month
- Phase 1: Foundations: Swarm Topologies (progressive mastery)
- Phase 2: Essential Skills: Queen Selection (progressive mastery)
- Phase 3: Consensus Mechanisms (progressive mastery)
- Phase 4: Custom Workflows (progressive mastery)

## Learning Order

**Follow this sequence:**

1. [Swarm Topologies](swarm-topologies.md) - Mesh, hierarchical, star, ring
2. [Queen Selection](queen-selection.md) - Strategic, tactical, adaptive
3. [Consensus Mechanisms](consensus-mechanisms.md) - Majority, weighted, Byzantine
4. [Custom Workflows](custom-workflows.md) - Build your own patterns

## You'll Know You're Ready When...

✅ You can choose the right topology for a project
✅ You understand when to use hierarchical vs mesh
✅ You can implement queen selection strategies
✅ You know when to use consensus mechanisms
✅ You can design custom coordination patterns

## Practice Project

**Build a distributed documentation system** (Intermediate phase total)

By the end of Phase 3: Intermediate, build this:

**Architecture**:
- Hierarchical topology (queen coordinator + team leads)
- 3 teams: Content, Technical Review, Publishing
- Consensus on major architectural decisions
- Custom workflow for multi-phase publishing

**Agents**:
- 1 Queen (hierarchical-coordinator)
- 3 Team Leads (content, review, publishing)
- 9 Specialist agents (3 per team)

**Coordination**:
- Queen assigns tasks to team leads
- Team leads coordinate specialists
- Consensus voting on content structure
- Custom checkpoints for quality gates

This is a real-world pattern used in production documentation systems.

## Key Concepts This Stage

### 1. Topologies Determine Coordination Patterns

**Mesh**: Peer-to-peer, all agents equal
- Use for: Collaborative work, brainstorming, research

**Hierarchical**: Tree structure, clear leadership
- Use for: Complex projects, clear task delegation

**Star**: Central coordinator, spoke agents
- Use for: Simple coordination, quick decisions

**Ring**: Circular workflow, sequential processing
- Use for: Pipeline processing, review chains

### 2. Queen Selection Affects Decision-Making

**Strategic Queen**: Long-term planning, architecture
**Tactical Queen**: Short-term execution, implementation
**Adaptive Queen**: Switches strategy based on context

### 3. Consensus Prevents Bad Decisions

**Majority Vote**: Simple, fast
**Weighted Vote**: Expert opinions matter more
**Byzantine**: Fault-tolerant, handles malicious actors

## Phase 3: Intermediate Success Indicators

By the end of Phase 3: Intermediate, you should:
1. Choose topologies without hesitation
2. Implement queen selection for complex projects
3. Use consensus for critical architectural decisions
4. Design custom workflows for your use cases

## Stage 2 Preview

In Phase 4: Advanced (Advanced), you'll learn:
- Full hive-mind coordination (all features combined)
- Byzantine consensus in production
- Adaptive topology switching at runtime
- ReasoningBank learning pipelines
- Self-improving workflows

## Common Phase 3: Intermediate Questions

**Q: When should I use hierarchical vs mesh?**
A: Hierarchical for complex projects with clear task breakdown. Mesh for collaborative exploration and research.

**Q: Do I always need a queen?**
A: No. Simple projects (5 agents or fewer) work fine without queens.

**Q: What's the overhead of consensus?**
A: additional coordination time for voting, but prevents costly mistakes.

**Q: Can I mix topologies?**
A: Yes! Advanced pattern: hierarchical overall, mesh within teams.
