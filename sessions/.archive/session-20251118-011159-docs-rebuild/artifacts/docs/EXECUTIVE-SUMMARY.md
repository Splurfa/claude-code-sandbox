## What Was Done

### Migration Execution
1. ✅ Analyzed tutor-mode skill and dependencies (TUTOR-AUDIT.md)
2. ✅ Created destination directory structure
3. ✅ Copied all 22 learning documents
4. ✅ Verified content integrity
5. ✅ Created comprehensive documentation

### Files Secured
- **Entry Point**: `00-start-here.md` - Learning orientation
- **Phase 1 (Foundations)**: 5 docs - Basic concepts and first steps
- **Phase 2 (Essential Skills)**: 5 docs - Multi-agent coordination
- **Phase 3 (Intermediate)**: 5 docs - Complex swarm orchestration
- **Phase 4 (Advanced)**: 5 docs - Self-learning systems
- **Support**: `progress-tracker.md` - Learning progress template

### Documentation Created
1. **TUTOR-MIGRATION-COMPLETE.md** - Technical verification report
2. **TUTOR-HANDOFF.md** - Integration guide for docs team
3. **MIGRATION-MANIFEST.md** - Complete file inventory and tracking
4. **EXECUTIVE-SUMMARY.md** (this document) - High-level overview

## What Happens Next

### Immediate Next Steps (Required)
1. **Update Tutor Skill References** (CRITICAL)
   - File: `.claude/skills/tutor-mode/SKILL.md`
   - Action: Replace 6 hardcoded session paths
   - Effort: 5 minutes
   - Impact: Tutor-mode becomes fully functional

### Short-Term Goals (Recommended)
2. **Integration Testing** (HIGH PRIORITY)
   - Test `/tutor start` command
   - Verify all learning doc links
   - Check memory integration
   - Validate progress tracking

3. **Plan Permanent Promotion** (HIGH PRIORITY)
   - Decide final docs/ structure mapping
   - Copy to permanent location
   - Update all references
   - Archive session materials

## Key Decisions Required

### 1. Permanent Location Strategy
**Options**:
- **A**: Keep in session artifacts until docs rebuild complete
- **B**: Promote to permanent docs/ immediately
- **C**: Hybrid - update skill now, promote later

**Recommendation**: Option C - update skill to new session location immediately, promote to permanent docs/ during final rebuild phase.

### 2. Path Reference Strategy
**Current State**: 6 hardcoded session paths in tutor skill
**Options**:
- **A**: Update to new session path (quick fix)
- **B**: Use relative references (future-proof)
- **C**: Use variables/config (most flexible)

**Recommendation**: Option A now (immediate functionality), Option B later (during permanent promotion).

## Impact Assessment

### Problem Solved ✅
**Before**: 22 learning documents trapped in session that would be archived
**After**: Materials secured in active session, ready for permanent promotion
**Impact**: Complete tutor-mode learning system preserved

### User Experience Impact
- **Before Migration**: Tutor-mode references broken when session archived
- **After Migration**: References will work after 6-line skill update
- **After Promotion**: Permanent, discoverable learning materials

### Educational Value Preserved
- **4 Learning Phases**: Foundations → Essential Skills → Intermediate → Advanced
- **16 Exercises**: From 20-min beginner exercises to 12-hour advanced challenges
- **Curriculum Duration**: 1-6 months of structured learning
- **Topics Covered**: Parallel execution, memory coordination, swarm orchestration, self-learning systems
