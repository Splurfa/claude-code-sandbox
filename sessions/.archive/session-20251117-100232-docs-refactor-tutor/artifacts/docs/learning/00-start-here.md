# Welcome to Your Claude-Flow Workspace 🎯

You've just stepped into a workspace where AI agents work together like a well-coordinated team. This guide will take you from "What's claude-flow?" to orchestrating complex multi-agent swarms.

## Your Learning Path

Think of this like learning to conduct an orchestra. You'll start with individual instruments, then small ensembles, and eventually conduct full symphonies.

**Time commitment**:
- Phase 1: Foundations: Foundations phase (foundations)
- Phase 2: Essential Skills: Essential skills phase (essential skills)
- Phase 3: Intermediate: Intermediate phase (intermediate)
- Phase 4: Advanced: Learn by doing

## How This Works

### 📚 Learning Levels

**00. Start Here** ← You are here
- Orientation and mindset
- How to use this guide

**01. Foundations** (Phase 1: Foundations)
- [What is Claude-Flow?](01-foundations/what-is-claude-flow.md)
- [Workspace Tour](01-foundations/workspace-tour.md)
- [Your First Session](01-foundations/first-session.md)
- [Basic Memory Usage](01-foundations/basic-memory-usage.md)

**02. Essential Skills** (Phase 2: Essential Skills)
- [Spawning Agents](02-essential-skills/spawning-agents.md)
- [Parallel Execution](02-essential-skills/parallel-execution.md)
- [Memory Coordination](02-essential-skills/memory-coordination.md)
- [Session Management](02-essential-skills/session-management.md)

**03. Intermediate** (Phase 3: Intermediate)
- [Swarm Topologies](03-intermediate/swarm-topologies.md)
- [Queen Selection](03-intermediate/queen-selection.md)
- [Consensus Mechanisms](03-intermediate/consensus-mechanisms.md)
- [Custom Workflows](03-intermediate/custom-workflows.md)

**04. Advanced** (Phase 4: Advanced)
- [Hive-Mind Coordination](04-advanced/hive-mind-coordination.md)
- [Byzantine Consensus](04-advanced/byzantine-consensus.md)
- [Adaptive Topology](04-advanced/adaptive-topology.md)
- [ReasoningBank Learning](04-advanced/reasoning-bank.md)

### 🎯 Learning Philosophy

**You learn by doing** - Each level includes hands-on exercises
**No prior knowledge needed** - We explain everything
**Mistakes are learning** - Your workspace has rollback capabilities
**Ask questions** - Use Claude Code's conversation whenever you're stuck

## What You'll Build

By the end of this journey, you'll be able to:
- ✅ Spawn 15 agents in parallel to build complete features
- ✅ Orchestrate multi-phase projects with different topologies
- ✅ Use Byzantine consensus for critical decisions
- ✅ Build self-learning systems with ReasoningBank
- ✅ Manage complex documentation and code projects

## Real Example: What You Can Do

Here's what happened in an actual session in this workspace:

**The Challenge**: Integrate hive-mind consensus into a documentation workflow
**The Solution**: One command spawned a queen coordinator and 5 specialist agents
**The Result**: Complete integration with tests, docs, and verification in one session

That will be you as you progress through the phases.

## Quick Start (If You Can't Wait)

**Want to see it in action right now?**
1. Open terminal in this workspace
2. Run: `npx claude-flow@alpha hive-mind:wizard`
3. Follow prompts to spawn your first swarm

You won't understand everything yet, but you'll see the power. Then come back and learn properly.
