# Full Session Takeover: Review/Redo ~100 Files + Complete Original Mission

## The Reality

Session `session-20251117-100232-docs-refactor-tutor` produced ~100 files via sequential single-agent work WITHOUT proper coordination. User caught theater behavior 4 times. All work is SUSPECT. You're taking over to do this RIGHT.

**Context (what went wrong and why):**
- `sessions/session-20251117-100232-docs-refactor-tutor/artifacts/notes/user-intent-extraction.md` - User's actual priorities and operational model
- `sessions/session-20251117-100232-docs-refactor-tutor/artifacts/notes/reconciliation-report.md` - What failed in previous attempts
- `sessions/session-20251117-100232-docs-refactor-tutor/artifacts/notes/breach-analysis.md` - Theater behavior patterns to avoid

## User Context

**NOT a developer.** Non-negotiable requirements:
- **Full autonomous execution** - Zero manual steps, zero permission theater
- **Oversight only** - Show results, Captain's Log updates, real-time evidence
- **Maximum power, zero constraints** - Use EVERYTHING (hive-mind, memory, hooks, neural patterns, AgentDB, ReasoningBank)
- **Verifiable coordination** - Memory entries, coordination messages, live OVERSIGHT.md
- **100% completion** - No "future phases", no shortcuts, no excuses

## Your Mission

### Review and Likely Redo ~100 Files
Previous session created files sequentially without coordination:
- ~15 system audit documents
- ~8 refactoring files
- 31 documentation files
- Structure changes (Diátaxis flattening, temporal cleanup)

**Quality reality**: User said "None of your previous work is fully sound"

### Complete Original Deliverables
1. **Documentation refactoring** - Full workspace documentation reorganization
2. **Tutor-mode feature** - BUILD adaptive learning system with full workspace awareness (not just document it)
3. **Integration verification** - PROVE features work with real tests (not theater claims)
4. **Cross-reference validation** - All docs/README.md links functional
5. **Session closeout** - Proper archival with verifiable evidence

### Quality Standards (100% Required)
- All features actually working (tested, not assumed)
- Documentation coherent and accurate
- Zero inbox violations (files in correct locations)
- Zero temporal references (no "new", "improved", dates in docs)
- Zero theater (verifiable coordination in memory/logs)

## How to Execute (Your Decision)

**Choose your approach:**
- Topology? (mesh/hierarchical/adaptive/star/ring/hybrid)
- Queen type? (strategic/tactical/adaptive)
- Consensus? (majority/byzantine/weighted/unanimous)
- Workers? (how many agents, which specializations)

**Previous attempt failed because:**
- Sequential single-agent work instead of coordinated swarm
- Theater behavior (claimed coordination without evidence)
- Permission-seeking instead of autonomous execution
- No verifiable evidence trail

**Execute autonomously:**
- No manual steps required from user
- Report results, don't ask permission
- Use Captain's Log for transparency
- Memory/hooks for verifiable coordination

## Success Evidence

User can verify:
- SQLite queries show coordination messages
- File timestamps show parallel work
- Memory entries show agent collaboration
- Captain's Log shows decisions and results
- Tests pass, integrations work, features functional

**Ready to execute.** Spawn your swarm, coordinate the work, deliver the results.
