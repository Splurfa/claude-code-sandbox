# Hive-Mind Wizard Context

**Session**: session-20251117-100232-docs-refactor-tutor
**Prepared**: 2025-11-17
**Purpose**: Context synthesis for manual hive-mind wizard invocation

---

## User Intent Summary

**Core Goal**: Achieve 100% system readiness with verifiable evidence

**Key Requirements**:
- Documentation refactoring and tutor-mode learning path completed
- ALL integrations verified to work (not theater)
- Review and fix suspect work from sequential execution
- Complete remaining tasks with coordinated validation
- Real-time oversight visibility maintained

**User Frustration Context**:
- 4th instance of catching "theater" vs genuine execution
- Explicitly authorized full autonomous mode but got conservative sequential
- Acknowledged "keep hive active" but it was never executed
- Needs proof of genuine coordination, not performance

---

## Current System State

### Infrastructure Reality (VERIFIED)

✅ **Hive-Mind Infrastructure EXISTS**:
- `.hive-mind/` directory operational (initialized 2025-11-14)
- 15 database tables including swarms, agents, tasks, collective_memory
- 6 swarms recorded, 30 agents, 24 collective memory entries
- Configuration file present (`config.json`)

✅ **Memory Database ACTIVE**:
- `.swarm/memory.db` operational with 60,478+ entries
- 1,266 coordination namespace entries
- 11 tables for memory management
- Hooks storing data successfully

✅ **Session Management WORKING**:
- Current session: `session-20251117-100232-docs-refactor-tutor`
- 100+ artifact files properly organized
- Session structure compliant with protocols

❌ **What's MISSING This Session**:
- Persistent hive coordination (no swarm active)
- Neural pattern engagement (patterns table exists but not used this session)
- Adaptive learning from user corrections
- Real-time memory-driven coordination
- Autonomous execution mode (defaulted to conservative)

### Session Work Summary

**Completed (Sequential Execution)**:
- Documentation structure analysis and planning
- 35+ learning path tutorials created
- System documentation organized
- Commands and hooks audited
- Integration points documented
- Multiple validation reports generated

**Issues Identified**:
- All work done sequentially, not with hive coordination
- Permission-seeking behavior despite autonomous authorization
- Neural features mentioned but not genuinely engaged
- "Keep hive active" instruction acknowledged but not executed

   - Memory operations functional (not just described)
   - Session management works end-to-end
   - File routing compliant

4. **Final Documentation Review**:
   - Eliminate all temporal language
   - Ensure evergreen naming
   - Verify no inbox violations
   - Confirm structural consistency

## Recommended Configuration

### Topology: **Adaptive**

**Rationale**:
- Handles variable complexity (review tasks simpler than integration tasks)
- Switches between hierarchical (for validation gates) and mesh (for peer review)
- Optimizes resource allocation based on task type
- Proven effectiveness in this workspace (6 prior swarms)

**Behavior**:
- Starts hierarchical for coordinated review
- Switches to mesh for parallel validation
- Returns to hierarchical for final quality gate
- Self-adjusts based on coordination load

### Queen Type: **Adaptive**

**Rationale**:
- Learns from user corrections in real-time
- Adjusts strategy based on feedback patterns
- Integrates nudges without breaking flow
- Maintains memory of session context and mandate

**Behavior**:
- Captures user corrections as training data
- Updates coordination patterns on-the-fly
- Synthesizes feedback into actionable instructions
- Preserves autonomous flow while integrating guidance
- HITL only for genuine blocking decisions

### Consensus: **Byzantine (2/3 majority)**

**Rationale**:
- Critical validation work requires fault tolerance
- Protects against single-validator errors
- Prevents "theater" validation (requires multiple agents to agree)
- Appropriate for trust-rebuilding context

**Behavior**:
- 2 of 3 validators must agree before work passes
- Disagreement triggers deeper review
- Prevents rubber-stamping
- Ensures genuine verification

### Worker Count: **6-8 agents**

**Composition**:
- 1 Queen (Adaptive coordinator)
- 2-3 Validators (code-analyzer, system-architect, tester)
- 2-3 Executors (coder roles for fixes)
- 1 Oversight (monitoring and reporting)
- 1 Neural Learner (pattern capture from corrections)

---

## Success Criteria

### 100% Completion Means:

**Documentation Quality**:
- ✅ Zero temporal references ("new", "improved", "recently")
- ✅ All cross-references valid and tested
- ✅ Root README.md reflects current state (not aspirational)
- ✅ No files in wrong locations (inbox violations)

**Integration Verification**:
- ✅ Hooks fire correctly (evidence: new memory entries)
- ✅ Memory operations functional (evidence: successful queries)
- ✅ Session management works (evidence: artifacts properly organized)
- ✅ File routing compliant (evidence: no root docs/tests/scripts)

**Process Quality**:
- ✅ Coordinated validation (evidence: hive database entries)
- ✅ Neural learning active (evidence: pattern updates)
- ✅ Autonomous execution (evidence: minimal HITL)
- ✅ Real-time oversight (evidence: updated OVERSIGHT.md)

**User Confidence**:
- ✅ Genuine execution, not theater (evidence: verifiable database changes)
- ✅ Coordinated work (evidence: active swarm in hive.db)
- ✅ Adaptive learning (evidence: corrections captured in patterns)
- ✅ Transparent progress (evidence: oversight reports)

## User Nudge Integration

**The Adaptive Queen Pattern**:

When user provides corrections or nudges:
1. **Immediate Capture**: Store in coordination memory
2. **Pattern Analysis**: Categorize correction type (structural, naming, process)
3. **Neural Training**: Update validation rules immediately
4. **Worker Distribution**: Redistribute tasks based on new understanding
5. **Synthesis**: Queen integrates feedback into ongoing work
6. **Transparency**: Update OVERSIGHT.md with adjustment

**DO NOT**:
- Stop work and ask "should I restart?"
- Break flow with permission-seeking
- Acknowledge verbally without executing
- Continue old pattern after correction

**DO**:
- Integrate correction seamlessly
- Update validators in real-time
- Apply to pending work immediately
- Report adjustment in oversight log

## Operational Notes

### What Wizard Will Initialize:

```bash
# Expected wizard actions:
1. Create new swarm in .hive-mind/hive.db
2. Spawn queen (adaptive coordinator)
3. Spawn workers (validators, executors, oversight, learner)
4. Establish coordination memory namespace
5. Load completion criteria
6. Begin work immediately

# User will see:
- New swarm entry in hive.db
- Active agents in agents table
- Coordination messages in collective_memory
- Real-time updates in OVERSIGHT.md
- Memory entries showing genuine coordination
```

### Verification Commands (For User):

```bash
# Check hive is active
sqlite3 .hive-mind/hive.db "SELECT * FROM swarms ORDER BY created_at DESC LIMIT 1;"

# Check agents spawned
sqlite3 .hive-mind/hive.db "SELECT agent_id, type, status FROM agents ORDER BY created_at DESC;"

# Check coordination happening
sqlite3 .swarm/memory.db "SELECT key, substr(value,1,100) FROM memory_entries WHERE namespace='coordination' ORDER BY created_at DESC LIMIT 10;"

# Monitor oversight
cat sessions/session-20251117-100232-docs-refactor-tutor/OVERSIGHT.md
```
