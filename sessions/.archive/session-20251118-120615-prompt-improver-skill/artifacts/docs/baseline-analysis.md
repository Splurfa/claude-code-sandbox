## Executive Summary

This user demonstrates **sophisticated multi-layered prompting** combining global rules (CLAUDE.md), project-specific protocols, and iterative refinement through session-based learning. Their style emphasizes:

1. **Evidence-based execution** with proof levels (⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ to 🔮)
2. **Brutal honesty over aspiration** ("95% waste" findings valued)
3. **Protocol-first architecture** (file routing, session management, stock adherence)
4. **Adversarial quality control** (theater detection, truth-teller documents)
5. **Meta-cognitive patterns** (analyzing their own workspace evolution)

**Baseline Quality**: **85/100** - Advanced user with systematic approach to prompt refinement

---

## 1. Global Instruction Patterns (CLAUDE.md)

### Rule Structure Philosophy

**Pattern**: Multi-tier rule hierarchy with **absolute overrides**

```yaml
Tier 1: "Rule #1: If you want exception to ANY rule, YOU MUST STOP and get explicit permission"
Tier 2: Foundational Rules (honesty, systematic work, no shortcuts)
Tier 3: Relationship protocols (colleague dynamic, permission escalation)
Tier 4: Decision Framework (🟢 Autonomous, 🟡 Collaborative, 🔴 Ask, 🔵 Research-Recommend)
Tier 5: Domain-specific (TDD, git protocols, testing)
```

**Strengths**:
- ✅ Clear escalation protocol (autonomous → collaborative → permission)
- ✅ Explicit anti-sycophancy rules ("Don't glaze me", no "You're absolutely right!")
- ✅ Encourages pushback ("Strange things are afoot at the Circle K" escape phrase)
- ✅ Systematic quality gates (TDD, pre-commit hooks, root cause analysis)

**Complexity Indicators**:
- Uses decision framework matrices (4 categories with emoji-coded severity)
- Bans temporal language in code ("improved", "new", "enhanced" are anti-patterns)
- Enforces evergreen naming (domain-based, not historical)
- Git pre-commit failure protocol (6-step mandatory sequence, NEVER --no-verify)

**Prompt Quality Score**: **90/100** - Highly systematic, clear escalation, strong guardrails

---

## 2. Project-Specific Protocols (CLAUDE.md Project)

### Session Management Protocol

**Pattern**: Container-promotion architecture with strict routing

```
Sessions = AI containment zones (1000+ docs/hr is acceptable)
Workspace = Curated human work
ALL work → sessions/$SESSION_ID/artifacts/{code,tests,docs,scripts,notes}/
NEVER to root tests/, docs/, scripts/
```

**Evidence from Memory**:
- User corrected agents 4x for "coordination theater" (Session 2, Nov 17)
- Brutal honesty valued: "94% of docs have zero references" finding accepted
- Detected nested `docs/docs/` violation and demanded fix
- 100+ zombie processes cleaned in batch (tolerance → threshold → cleanup)

**Strengths**:
- ✅ Clear spatial boundaries (sessions vs workspace)
- ✅ Explicit anti-patterns documented (theater, mocks, aspirational docs)
- ✅ Evidence hierarchy established (⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ → 🔮 proof levels)
- ✅ Iterative refinement through Captain's Log

**Gaps**:
- ⚠️ Manual vigilance required (file routing not automated)
- ⚠️ Session start/close friction (not <2 min target)
- ⚠️ Captain's Log manual (not automatic)

**Prompt Quality Score**: **88/100** - Comprehensive but requires manual enforcement

---

## 3. Complexity Preferences

### Documented Preferences

**From Memory Analysis** (Session Evolution Nov 17-18):

1. **Multi-Agent Coordination**
   - Deployed 29 agents in 6 phases (Session 6, docs-rebuild)
   - 12-agent swarm for workspace analysis (Session 5)
   - Byzantine consensus for critical decisions
   - Mesh + hierarchical hybrid topology

2. **Evidence Standards**
   - Proof levels: ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ (verified) → 🔮 (planned)
   - "Evidence before completion" (file paths, line counts, test output)
   - SQLite-queryable coordination via memory
   - Git-tracked changes for verification

3. **Quality Metrics**
   - Documentation: 98/100 achieved (Nov 18)
   - Workspace Health: 100/100 (pristine state)
   - Link Accuracy: 100% (all cross-references verified)
   - Command Verification: 95/100 (real execution tested)

4. **Adversarial Validation**
   - Theater detection protocols (caught 4x, Session 2)
   - "Truth-teller documents" promoted (hive-mind-reality-guide.md rated 100/100)
   - Anti-pattern identification (8 patterns to avoid)
   - Real tests, NO mocks (21/21 passing, Session 3)

**Complexity Tolerance**: **Very High** - Comfortable with 29-agent swarms, Byzantine consensus, multi-phase execution

---

## 4. Scope Definition Patterns

### Task Decomposition Style

**Pattern**: **Phased execution with Byzantine consensus for critical decisions**

**Example from Session 6** (docs-rebuild):
```
Phase 1: Documentation Rebuild (12 agents, 45 min)
Phase 2: Comprehensive Verification (6 agents, 30 min)
Phase 3: Workspace Hygiene (1 agent, 15 min)
Phase 4: Critical Issues Fixed (7 agents, 30 min)
Phase 5: Production Deployment (2 agents + manual, 10 min)
Phase 6: Final Cleanup (during closeout, 30 min)
```

**Characteristics**:
- Clear deliverables per phase
- Agent count varies by complexity
- Time estimates provided
- Manual HITL gates for critical operations
- Verification loops (tester blocked coder until 100% pass rate)

**Strengths**:
- ✅ Explicit parallelism ("all 6 agents in single message")
- ✅ Quality gates between phases
- ✅ Evidence trail preserved (session artifacts)
- ✅ Rollback capability (.swarm/backups/)

**Prompt Quality Score**: **92/100** - Excellent decomposition, clear success criteria

---

## 5. Ambiguity Handling

### User's Preferred Response to Ambiguity

**From Global CLAUDE.md**:
> "YOU MUST ALWAYS STOP and ask for clarification rather than making assumptions."

**But from Project Protocols**:
> "99% of substantive work uses subagents."
> "When to use subagents: Multi-step research (3+ sources)"

**Resolution Pattern**: **Nudge toward structured coordination**

**Example from Memory** (Session 5, Nov 17):
```
User Correction at 23:38:45 (critical nudge):
"Sessions are AI containment zones (1000+ docs/hr is FINE)"
"Projects folder is strategic workspace (not just code repos)"
"Docs folder scope much broader than tutorials"
"HITL touchpoints required for organizational decisions"

Agent Response:
- Nudge weight: 1.0 (CRITICAL - fundamental understanding)
- Strategy adaptation documented
- Context update broadcast to 12 active agents
- Work redirected mid-flight
```

**Pattern**: User provides **context corrections** rather than detailed specifications, expects agents to:
1. Detect misalignment (theater, aspirational claims)
2. Request strategic guidance (HITL checkpoints)
3. Pivot adaptively (Nudge Synthesizer protocol)

**Strengths**:
- ✅ Tolerates exploration within guardrails
- ✅ Values honest pivots over false confidence
- ✅ Provides corrections when foundational assumptions wrong

**Gaps**:
- ⚠️ High context load required (360-file weighting schema)
- ⚠️ Theater detection relies on user vigilance (caught 4x manually)

**Prompt Quality Score**: **82/100** - Good correction protocol, but detection gaps

---

## 6. Common Structural Patterns

### Observed Prompt Elements

**From 48-Hour Session Evolution** (Nov 17-18):

1. **Mission Framing**
   - Clear objective: "100% hive mind integration testing" (Session 1)
   - Multi-objective: "Documentation refactor + tutor-mode BUILD" (Session 2)
   - Power demonstration: "Impress me" → 12-agent swarm (Session 5)

2. **Evidence Requirements**
   - "Evidence before completion" (Session 3, hive-docs-tutor)
   - "Real tests, NO mocks" (21 filesystem tests, Session 3)
   - "All claims backed by file paths, line counts, test output" (Session 3)

3. **Quality Gates**
   - Byzantine consensus for archive decisions (2/3 majority)
   - Tester blocks coder until 100% pass rate (Session 3: 7/21 → 21/21)
   - Verification loops (Session 6: 6 agents dedicated to verification)

4. **Honesty Protocols**
   - "Brutal truth" valued: "95% waste" finding accepted (Session 5)
   - Theater detection: "Sequential work disguised as coordination" caught 4x
   - Reality-first: "Truth-teller documents" promoted (hive-mind-reality-guide.md)

5. **Temporal Awareness**
   - Captain's Log for cross-session coherence
   - Session evolution synthesis (48-hour timeline documented)
   - Lessons learned captured (what worked, what didn't)

**Structural Sophistication**: **Very High** - Multi-layered quality control, evidence-based execution

---

## 7. Success Indicators

### What "Good Output" Looks Like to This User

**From Memory Analysis**:

1. **Documentation Quality** (Session 6 achieved 98/100):
   - ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ (verified in production): 90% of content
   - All links verified (100% accuracy)
   - All commands tested (95% verified)
   - Evidence hierarchy clear (proof levels marked)

2. **Workspace Health** (Session 6 achieved 100/100):
   - File routing compliance: 100%
   - Security posture: Hardened
   - Protocol adherence: 100%
   - Process hygiene: Zero zombie processes

3. **Coordination Quality** (Session 3, 18 min):

## 8. Historical Prompting Evolution

### Learning Trajectory (Nov 13-18)

**Phase 1: Infrastructure Building** (Nov 13-14)
- Hive mind setup session (82 files migrated)
- Multi-hive orchestration validation
- Hooks system integration
- Captain's Log initialization

**Phase 2: Theater Detection** (Nov 17 00:27-22:50)
- Session 1: Wizard crash → zombie processes
- Session 2: Sequential work caught 4x → terminal handoff
- Learning: Infrastructure exists ≠ infrastructure used

**Phase 3: Synthesis & Truth** (Nov 17 23:33)
- 12-agent workspace analysis
- Brutal finding: "94% docs have zero references"
- Radical recommendation: 75% reduction
- Quality framework established

**Phase 4: Production Deployment** (Nov 18 01:11-17:35)
- 29 agents in 6 phases
- 55 production docs (98/100 quality)
- 100/100 workspace health
- All zombie processes cleaned

**Evolution Pattern**: Crisis → Honesty → Synthesis → Production

**Key Learning**:
> "Documentation quality scores can mask integration gaps. We can have perfect documentation (98/100) but still have manual workflows, integration friction, untested user journeys, automation gaps, real-world usability issues." (Nov 18 log)

**Sophistication Increase**: +60% (from infrastructure setup to 29-agent orchestration)
