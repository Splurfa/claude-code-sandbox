## Broken Anchor Links

These links point to anchors that may not exist:

### docs/operate/session-management.md

- **Line 639**: `[File Routing](../setup/quick-start.md#file-routing-rules-critical)`
  - Target file: `docs/setup/quick-start.md`
  - Missing anchor: `#file-routing-rules-critical`

## Recommendations

### Fix Broken File Links

Common patterns found in broken links:

1. **Old structure references** - Links still pointing to deprecated directories:
   - `01-foundations/`, `02-essential-skills/`, `03-intermediate/`, `04-advanced/`
   - `essentials/`, `advanced/`, `learning/`, `explanation/`, `reality/`
   
   These should be updated to the new structure:
   - `setup/`, `operate/`, `build/`, `coordinate/`, `reference/`

2. **Relative path issues** - Links using `../` that may need adjustment

### Fix Broken Anchors

Verify these sections exist in target files or update the anchor references.

## Next Steps

1. Review each broken link individually
2. Update links to point to correct new structure
3. Verify anchor names match actual headers
4. Re-run validation to confirm fixes
